        <h2>Prerequisites and Setup</h2>
        <p>This template demonstrates interaction from a spray web application with Memcached and therefore requires it to be installed.</p>
        <p>Go to <a href="http://memcached.org/">memcached.org</a> to install
					the correct version for your operating system. To ensure that it is
					up and running, you can try telneting to it.
					<pre>
						<code>
						telnet localhost 11211
						</code>

        <h2>General Overview</h2>
        <p>This template uses spray-can to create a basic RESTful interface. If you run the application you can go to <a href="http://localhost:8080/profile">localhost:8080/profile</a> to see a simple JSON response for the service</p>
        <p>The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/rest/ProfileServiceComponent.scala" class="shortcut">ProfileServiceComponent</a> class is where we define the Profile route and add a few endpoints</p>
        <p></p>

			<h2>Using Memcached</h2>
			<p>To see how Memcached is being used with the app, take a look at the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/rest/ProfileServiceComponent.scala" class="shortcut">routes</a> again. Caching is done via the <a href="http://spray.io/documentation/1.0.1/spray-routing/caching-directives/cache/" >cache directive</a>. The cache directive accepts an implementation of a Spray cache which usually references the default <code>LruCache</code>. However, this template provides a custom implementation of a Spray cache: the <a href"#code/src/main/scala/com/credera/cache/MemcachedCache.scala" class="shortcut">Memcache Cache</a>. The basic idea is the same as the LruCache implementation, except that we use Memcached instead of a ConcurrentHashMap for storing entries.</p>
			<p>Now lets look at Memcache in action. First make get request for all
				profiles. <code>curl localhost:8080/profile</code>.  You should get a
				response and in your console you should see a note that the database has
			been accessed to fulfill the request.  If you don't see a note, you might
		already have a cache entry in memcache, in which case you can restart
		memcache to clear it. Now if you repeat the request, you should not see
		another print out statement in which case the request was fulfilled from
		memcache.</p>
