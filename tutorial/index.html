        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>In this template, we’ll build a small Spray application that provides a RESTful API for the management
            of Profiles in order to demonstrate how the Spray routing and caching libraries can be 
            used to manage an external cache.</p>
        <p>More specifically, we'll use the spymemcached client
            library to build an implementation of the Spray Cache trait that can manage Spray
            RouteResponses within an external Memcached or Hazelcast process.</p>
        <p>During startup of the application an H2 database will be populated with 2 Profiles.
           Initial requests for those resources will be forwarded to the database and responses cached.
           Subsequent requests will be served by the cache unless otherwise evicted due to 
           updates or deletions of said resources.
    </div>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>A common need for many applications is the ability to not only read and modify a cache 
            store, but for that cache to be externalized from the process that is accessing the data 
            so that the data contained within the cache can be accessed from multiple applications 
            or processes that operate independently of each other.</p>
        <p>For example, imagine an application that provides a RESTful endpoint to return a user’s 
            profile information.  Furthermore, imagine that the implementation of that RESTful 
            endpoint amalgamates data from several other external systems to build the representation 
            of the profile, and that the invocation of that endpoint takes a long time to complete.  
            We might reduce the time it takes to return the profile on subsequent invocations by 
            storing the initial result in a cache that can be accessed for the second, third, etc. 
            call to return the same profile.</p>
        <p>Taking the example one step further, imagine that there are two instances of that 
            application, A and B, running behind a load balancer that distributes requests in a 
            round-robin fashion.  If application A receives the first request for a given profile, 
            we want the resulting profile to be stored in an external cache so that if a subsequent 
            request for the same profile is forwarded to application B, it can retrieve the profile 
            from cache without having to also make the time consuming calls to the external systems 
            that were already made by A.</p>
        <p>The Spray caching library provides two in-memory cache implementations using an underlying 
            ConcurrentLinkedHashMap.  But if we want to externalize the cache such that it can be 
            shared across applications as in the example above, those implementations will 
            not suffice.  We'll instead implement a Spray Cache using the spymemcached library in 
            order to integrate with Memcached, which will run in a process separate from our application.</p>

        <h2>The Cache</h2>
        
        <h3>A Minor Caveat</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this template is to show an example implementation of a
           Spray Cache that can be used for integrating a Spray application with a cache store 
           that runs in a separate process (i.e. outside of the JVM running the Spray application).
           However, it's also desirable to make this tutorial as self contained as possible.</p>
        <p>In light of both goals, the authors have decided to use the 
        <a href="https://code.google.com/p/jmemcache-daemon/" target="_blank">jmemcached</a> library instead
        of running <a href="http://www.memcached.org/" target="_blank">Memcached.</a>  This allows us
        to run both the Spray application and manage a cache that conforms to the Memcached protocol
        within the same JVM process.</p>
        
        <p>If you desire to do so, you can nevertheless use an external
        Memcached process with this tutorial without changing any code other than commenting out
        the following two lines from
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/boot/Boot.scala" class="shortcut">Boot.scala</a>.</p>
        
        <pre><code>
HazelcastProcess 
MemcachedProcess
        </code></pre>
        <p><i>For details concerning how to install Memcached, please refer to the Memcached website.</i></p>
        
        
        <h3>Starting the Cache</h3>  
        <p>The cache is initialized by Boot.scala on startup of the application.
        
        <pre><code>
object Boot extends App {

  //HazelcastProcess 
  MemcachedProcess
  ProfilesDatabase

  implicit val system = ActorSystem("spray-can")
  val service = system.actorOf(Props[ProfileActor], "profile-service")

  IO(Http) ! Http.Bind(service, interface = "localhost", port = 8080)

}        
        
        </code></pre>    
        
        <p><b>MemcachedProcess</b></p>
        <p><a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/cache/MemcachedProcess.scala"class="shortcut">MemcachedProcess</a>
           starts and configures a MemCacheDaemon (a jmemcached class).  This is the
           cache that our application will be using to store RouteResponses.  The cache is configured
           based on the <i>memcached</i> property values provided in the 
           <a href="#code/src/main/resources/application.conf"class="shortcut">application.conf</a> file.
           Please note that while <i>memcached.hosts</i> is a List of strings in the format of <i>ip</i>:<i>port</i>,
           only the first value from the List will be used.</p>
        
        <p><b>HazelcastProcess</b></p>
        <p>Did you notice the commented out <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/cache/HazelcastProcess.scala"class="shortcut">HazelcastProcess</a>?
           It just so happens that <a href="http://www.hazelcast.com" target="_blank">Hazelcast</a> is compatible with Memcached clients.  And since we've
           used the spymemcached library to implement <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/cache/MemcachedCache.scala"class="shortcut">MemcachedCache</a> (our Spray Cache), we can use
           MemcachedCache with Hazelcast as well.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to use Hazelcast instead of jmemcached, simply comment out MemcachedProcess
           and uncomment HazelcastProcess in Boot.scala like so:</p>
           <pre><code>
  HazelcastProcess 
  //MemcachedProcess          
           </code></pre>          
         <p>HazelcastProcess is configured with the same application.conf properties as MemcachedProcess.</p> 
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h2>Spray Cache Implementation</h2>
        <p><a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/cache/MemcachedCache.scala"class="shortcut">MemcachedCache</a>
           is an implementation of 
           <a href="https://github.com/spray/spray/blob/master/spray-caching/src/main/scala/spray/caching/Cache.scala" target="_blank">spray.caching.Cache</a> 
           that uses the spymemcached library.  Within this application, MemcachedCache is used for caching 
           <a href="https://github.com/spray/spray/blob/master/spray-routing/src/main/scala/spray/routing/directives/CachingDirectives.scala" target="_blank">RouteResponses</a> of 
           <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/rest/ProfileService.scala" class="shortcut">ProfileService</a>.
           However, it can just as well be used to cache any other type of serializable object.</p>
           
        <h3>Some Notes on the Implementation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Although MemcachedCache is generic, the companion object provides a factory method (routeCache)
              that returns an instance parameterized with RouteResponse.</li>
          <li><code>apply(key: Any, genValue: () => Future[V])</code> checks for an entry within the cache based on the provided key, and if not found,
          inserts a value into the cache based on genValue.</li>
          <li><code>def remove(key: Any)</code> is called by ProfileService for all POSTs, PUTs, and DELETEs of Profile resources.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>   
    
    <div>
        <h2>ProfileService</h2>
        <p><a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/rest/ProfileService.scala" class="shortcut">ProfileService</a>
         implements <a href="https://github.com/spray/spray/blob/master/spray-routing/src/main/scala/spray/routing/HttpService.scala" target="_blank">spray.routing.HttpService</a>, 
         and provides the RESTful API for managing Profiles.</p>
        <p>Let's step through the code:</p>
        
        <p>1.  We first get a reference to <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/example/dao/ProfileDAO.scala" class="shortcut">ProfileDAO</a>, 
          which is going to provide the API for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting Profiles 
          from a data store -- in our case an H2 database.</p>         
          <pre><code>
private val profileDAO = ProfileDAO          
          </code></pre>        

        <p>2.  Next, we create an instance of <i>MemcachedCache[spray.routing.directives.CachingDirectives.RouteResponse]</i>, which
           will be used for storing and removing our RouteResponses.</p>             
          <pre><code>
private val theCache = MemcachedCache.routeCache(Memcached.hosts, Memcached.timeToLive)          
          </code></pre>        
    
       <p>3.  We then define a custom keyer that returns just the path and parameters of the request.
          This will be useful to us in the case that we have multiple instances of the same 
          application accessible through different IP addreses or ports.</p>
       <p>For example, let's say we have the same application running on two different ports
          under the same IP address - http://127.0.0.1:8080 and  http://127.0.0.1:9090.
          We wouldn't want to save individual entries for each application in the external cache
          with keys of <i>http://127.0.0.1:8080/profiles</i> and <i>http://127.0.0.1:9090/profiles</i>.</p>
          
       <p>It'd be preferable to simply have a single cache entry with a key of <i>/profiles</i> that's
          accessible by both instances of the application.  That allows each application to benefit from the 
          work that's already been done by the other.               
          <pre><code>
implicit val relativeUriKeyer = CacheKeyer { 
  case RequestContext(HttpRequest(GET, uri, _, _, _), _, _) => uri.toRelative
}            
          </code></pre> 
          
          
       <p>4.  We wrap most of our route definition in the <i>alwaysCache</i> directive, passing it 
              our MemcachedCache for persisting responses to jmemcached (or Hazelcast).</p>             
          <pre><code>
val profileRoute = {
  alwaysCache(theCache) {
  ...rest of route definition...
  }
}            
          </code></pre>              


       <p>5.  In cases where we modify the Profile resource, we want to make sure that we evict
              any associated cache entries, so that subsequent requests to GET that
              resource will return the most up to date version.</p>
       <p> Because of this, you'll notice that all POST, PUT, and DELETE requests make a call
       to <code>evictCache(uri: Uri, evictParentPath: Boolean)</code>.</p>
       <p>The definition of evictCache is shown below.</p>
       <p>What evictCache does is pretty straight-forward.  It will evict the cache based on the URI
          provided, and optionally its parent path.  For instance, if the URI is <i>/profiles/1</i>, the
          parent path is considered to be <i>/profiles</i>.</p>
       <p>As an example of where we might want to evict the cache entry of the parent path consider the 
          following scenario:
          <ol>
              <li>A call to GET /profiles is made, querying and caching all profiles from the database.</li>
              <li>A call to GET /profiles/1 is made, creating a cache entry for Profile with id == 1. </li>
              <li>A call to DELETE /profiles/1 is made, deleting the Profile with id == 1. </li>
          </ol>
          </p> 
          <p>Steps 1 and 2 both create individual cache entries, each containing the data for the Profile with id == 1.
             When we delete the very same Profile, we want to make sure that its details are removed from both cache entries.
             Therefore, we need to remove the cache for both GET /profiles and GET /profiles/1.  By passing in <i>true</i>, for
             the evictParentPath argument, we'll ensure that this happens.</p>
            
          <pre><code>
private def evictCache(uri: Uri, evictParentPath: Boolean) = {
  theCache.remove(uri.toRelative)
  if(evictParentPath) {
    val uriString = uri.toRelative.toString
    theCache.remove(uriString.substring(0, uriString.lastIndexOf("/")))        
  }
}           
          </code></pre>              
             
    </div>
